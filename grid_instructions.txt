1. You can see what you'll be building in this exercise
here.
In style.css, add the
rid-tem late-areas • -
ruleset.
. container
Its value should create a 2-column, 4-row layout
with these areas:
• header (spans two columns in the first row)
• nav (spans two columns in the second row)
• left (spans one column on the left in the third
row)
• right (spans one column on the right in the
third row)
• footer (spans two columns in the fourth row)

2. In style.css, inside the
ruleset, set the header
property to have a value of header

3. Follow the same pattern for the nav, left, right and footer
rulesets in style.css.
